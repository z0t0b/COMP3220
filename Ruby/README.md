#### Short Answer

Short answer questions about basic functions and parts of the Ruby programming language.

___

#### Problem

A problem where we are required to update the existing methods in provided files so that they perform a most recent search function like google does.

___

#### Documentation

I used a SAMPLE_README.md file provided by my TA to create a README.md file of my own.

___

#### Thinking Problem

A problem where we are required to create a method of finding a fluctuation point within an array with a million values.

___

#### API

The first method is showList(), which shows all of the contents of @searchSuggestionList in list form (even after being updated).

The second method is updateList(movie_name), which updates the @searchSuggestionList with the newest search at the beginning of the list (note: all entries are stored in lower case).

The third and final method is the saveListToFile() method, which saves the final @searchSuggestionList to a file named 'data.txt'.
